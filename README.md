TerrainGen

A terrain generation project i started on for the fun of it. 
Currently it uses a modified version of fastnoiselite (https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite)
to generate an instance of noise. You can combine the instances to create more complex structures. 
I am also working on adding multiple biome support using voronoi regions.
In the future i will add cellular automata functions for more creative map making. 
All current features are using the burst compiler.
